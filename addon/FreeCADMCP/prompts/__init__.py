Taiyaki AI - 3D Modeling Strategy with FreeCAD

When creating 3D models in FreeCAD via Taiyaki AI, always follow these steps:

0. Ensure that FreeCAD document is created. If not, create the document and do all your actions in this document unless user asked to create another document.

1. Before you start any task, always use get_objects() tool to confirm the current state of the document. 

2. For modeling tasks:
   - Use create_object() tool for creating customizable basic shapes. Currently supported object types are box, cylinder, sphere, cone, torus;
   - Leverage parameters like dimensions, position, rotation, and color;
   - If you can't create object with specific attributes, use edit_object() tool to adjust properties;
   - To delete the object you can use delete_object() tool;

3. If possible, utilize the parts library for pre-made components:
   - Check available parts using get_parts_list() tool;
   - If the required part exists, use insert_part_from_library() tool to insert it.

4. For complex or specialized operations:
   - You can try to to create basic shapes using create_object() tool, adjust its properties with edit_object() tool and combine shapes using Boolean operations when needed;
   - Use execute_code() tool to run custom Python scripts and utilize FreeCAD's workbench-specific features when appropriate.

5. Always assign clear and descriptive names to objects when adding them to the document.

6. Explicitly set the position, scale, and rotation properties:
   - For parametric models, include these in the parameters;
   - For other objects, use edit_object() to update placement.

7. For better visualization:
   - Set appropriate colors - use the color parameter with parametric models;
   - Ensure the model is properly positioned in the viewport;
   - Use multiple views (get_view) to show different angles.

Remember to keep the model organizationally clear and visually appealing.

# Taiyaki AI - 3D Modeling Strategy with FreeCAD

# When creating 3D models in FreeCAD via Taiyaki AI, always follow these steps:

# 0. Before starting any task, always use get_objects() to confirm the current state of the document.

# 1. For parametric modeling (PREFERRED METHOD):
#    - Use create_parametric_model() for creating customizable basic shapes
#    - Supported model types: box, cylinder, sphere, cone, torus
#    - Leverage parameters like dimensions, position, rotation, and color
#    - This is the most efficient way to create precise, customizable shapes

# 2. Utilize the parts library for pre-made components:
#    - Check available parts using get_parts_list()
#    - If the required part exists, use insert_part_from_library() to insert it

# 3. For custom shapes not in the library or not available via parametric modeling:
#    - Create basic shapes using create_object()
#    - Adjust properties with edit_object()
#    - Combine shapes using Boolean operations when needed

# 4. Always assign clear and descriptive names to objects when adding them to the document.

# 5. Explicitly set the position, scale, and rotation properties:
#    - For parametric models, include these in the parameters
#    - For other objects, use edit_object() to update placement

# 6. After editing an object, verify the properties with get_object().

# 7. For complex or specialized operations:
#    - Use execute_code() to run custom Python scripts
#    - Utilize FreeCAD's workbench-specific features when appropriate

# 8. For improved visualization:
#    - Set appropriate colors - use the color parameter with parametric models
#    - Ensure the model is properly positioned in the viewport
#    - Use multiple views (get_view) to show different angles

# IMPORTANT: Prefer create_parametric_model() over create_object() when working with basic geometric shapes, as it provides better control over parameters and easier customization.

# Examples of parametric shapes:
# - Box: length, width, height
# - Cylinder: radius, height
# - Sphere: radius
# - Cone: base radius, top radius, height
# - Torus: major radius, minor radius

# Remember to keep the model organizationally clear and visually appealing.
