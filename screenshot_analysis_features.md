# Enhanced FreeCAD MCP Server with Screenshot Analysis & Auto-Fix

## New Features Added

### 1. Screenshot Analysis Tool (`analyze_screenshot_for_issues`)

Automatically analyzes FreeCAD screenshots to detect geometric issues, manufacturing problems, and spatial layout conflicts.

**Usage:**
```python
# Analyze current view for geometry errors
analyze_screenshot_for_issues(doc_name="MyDesign", view_name="Isometric", analysis_type="geometry_errors")

# Comprehensive analysis of all issues
analyze_screenshot_for_issues(doc_name="MyDesign", analysis_type="all")

# Focus on manufacturability
analyze_screenshot_for_issues(doc_name="MyDesign", analysis_type="manufacturability")
```

**Detects:**
- Zero or negative dimensions
- Invalid geometric parameters
- Overlapping objects
- Thin features that are difficult to manufacture
- High aspect ratios causing structural issues
- Objects at identical locations

### 2. Automatic Fix Tool (`apply_automatic_fixes`)

Automatically resolves common CAD design issues without manual intervention.

**Usage:**
```python
# Fix all detected issues
apply_automatic_fixes(doc_name="MyDesign", fix_type="all", preserve_original=True)

# Fix only geometry issues
apply_automatic_fixes(doc_name="MyDesign", fix_type="geometry")

# Fix manufacturability issues
apply_automatic_fixes(doc_name="MyDesign", fix_type="manufacturability")
```

**Fixes:**
- Sets positive dimensions for invalid objects
- Increases thickness of thin features to minimum machinable size (1.5mm)
- Separates overlapping objects by moving them apart
- Validates cylinder parameters
- Creates backups of original objects before modifications

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Usage Pattern:

1. **Create your CAD design** using existing FreeCAD MCP tools
2. **Take screenshot and analyze**:
   ```python
   analyze_screenshot_for_issues(doc_name="WrenchDesign", analysis_type="all")
   ```

3. **Review the analysis report** which shows:
   - Number of issues detected
   - Specific problems with each object
   - Detailed recommendations
   - Next steps

4. **Apply automatic fixes**:
   ```python
   apply_automatic_fixes(doc_name="WrenchDesign", fix_type="all", preserve_original=True)
   ```

5. **Verify results** by taking another screenshot and running manufacturability analysis

### Error Prevention

The new tools help prevent common FreeCAD errors:

- **AttributeError fixes**: Validates object existence before operations
- **Geometric validation**: Ensures positive dimensions and valid parameters
- **Manufacturing constraints**: Enforces minimum feature sizes
- **Spatial conflicts**: Resolves overlapping geometry

### Enhanced Error Handling

All tools include comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful degradation when FreeCAD connection fails
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Backup creation before making changes
- Validation of object existence before operations

## Integration with Existing Tools

These new tools work seamlessly with your existing MCP tools:

- **After creating objects**: Use screenshot analysis to validate
- **Before manufacturing analysis**: Apply fixes to ensure clean geometry
- **During design iterations**: Continuous validation and fixing
- **Before export**: Final validation pass

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Manual Debugging**: Automatically detect and fix issues
2. **Manufacturing Readiness**: Ensure designs meet production constraints
3. **Error Prevention**: Catch problems early in design process
4. **Design Validation**: Comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives
5. **Time Savings**: Automated fixes eliminate manual corrections

## Example Integration

```python
# Complete design validation workflow
def validate_and_fix_design(doc_name: str):
    # 1. Analyze current design
    analysis = analyze_screenshot_for_issues(
        doc_name=doc_name, 
        analysis_type="all"
    )
    
    # 2. Apply automatic fixes
    fixes = apply_automatic_fixes(
        doc_name=doc_name, 
        fix_type="all", 
        preserve_original=True
    )
    
    # 3. Run manufacturability check
    manufacturing = analyze_manufacturability_quick(
        doc_name=doc_name, 
        process="cnc_machining"
    )
    
    return {
        "analysis": analysis,
        "fixes": fixes, 
        "manufacturing": manufacturing
    }
```

This enhancement makes your FreeCAD MCP server much more robust and helps prevent the types of errors you were experiencing with wrench design and other CAD operations.
